### **React State Management**
```javascript
const clearChat = () => {
  if (messages.length === 0) return;
  
  if (window.confirm('Are you sure you want to clear all chat history? This action cannot be undone.')) {
    setMessages([]);
    setInputMessage('');
    setSelectedImage(null);
    if (fileInputRef.current) {
      fileInputRef.current.value = '';
    }
  }
};
```

### **Button Component**
```jsx
<button
  className="clear-chat-btn"
  onClick={clearChat}
  disabled={messages.length === 0 || isLoading}
  title={`Clear all chat history (${messages.length} messages)`}
>
  <Trash2 size={18} />
  <span>Clear Chat</span>
  {messages.length > 0 && (
    <span className="message-count">({messages.length})</span>
  )}
</button>
```

### **CSS Styling**
